When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 I want to work remote when i use different computers to do my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If it is done automatically it would be a huge list and it doesn't has any logic so, it is manual pull is better as we can commit based on logic.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clones --- creation of a copy to our workspace.
fork --- copy between git-hubs.
branches --- different version copies.
